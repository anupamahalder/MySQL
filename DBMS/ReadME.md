<br>
To uniquely identify any record using a particular data we use primary key. Here Roll is primary key. <br>

## Composite Primary Key:
Where two or more columns/fields are needed to uniquely identify a record from a table.
<br>
Table: Course 
| Course ID | College | Credit |

| CSE 01    | ABC     | 7      |
| CSE 02    | JNU     | 6      |
| CSE 01    | PQR     | 8      |
| CSE 03    | VC      | 3      |
<br>
Here to uniquely identify a record we need primary key as (Course ID, College) together.
